    /*
    * A functional interface is an interface that contains only one abstract method. They can have only one functionality
    * to exhibit. From Java 8 onwards, lambda expressions can be used to represent the instance of a functional interface.
    *  A functional interface can have any number of default methods. Runnable, ActionListener, Comparable are some of the
    *  examples of functional interfaces.
    *
    *
    * Functional interfaces are included in Java SE 8 with Lambda expressions and Method references in order to
    * make code more readable, clean, and straightforward. Functional interfaces are interfaces that ensure that they
    * include precisely only one abstract method. Functional interfaces are used and executed by representing the interface
    * with an annotation called @FunctionalInterface. As described earlier, functional interfaces can contain only one abstract
    *  method. However, they can include any quantity of default and static methods.
