     * The word polymorphism means having many forms. In simple words, we can define polymorphism as the ability of a

     *  Real-life Illustration: Polymorphism
     *  A person at the same time can have different characteristics. Like a man at the same time is a father,
     a husband, an employee. So the same person possesses different behavior in different situations. This is called polymorphism.
